	<h1>Ten Little Soldiers</h1>
	<p>Ten little soldier boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were Nine.
<br>
Nine little soldier boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were Eight.
<br>
Eight little soldier boys going up to heaven, one fell down the stairs and then there were Seven.
<br>
Seven little soldier boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.
<br>
Six little soldier boys playing with a hive; A bumble bee stung one and then there were Five.
<br>
Five little soldier boys going in for law; One got into Chancery and then there were Four.
<br>
Four little soldier boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.
<br>
Three little soldier boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.
<br>
Two little soldier boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was One.
<br>
One little soldier boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were None.

<p>This book really reminds me of "Dexter", A T.V. show about a serial killer, who kills other serial killers. Justice Wargrave does the same thing by killing nine people he thought deserved it. Also Dexter has his own ritual where he prepares each kill. Justice Wargave has a line of a poem for everyone he kills.<br>	I can't relate to this book in any way because it's about a bunch of killers. This book shows that there are some screwed up people in the world who kill for fun.</p>
